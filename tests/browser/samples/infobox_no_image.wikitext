Kesey had a football scholarship for his freshman year, but switched to University of Oregon wrestli

 he received the Fred Low Scholarship for outstanding Northwest wrestler. In 1957, Kesey was second

A brother of [[Beta Theta Pi]], Kesey graduated from the [[University of Oregon School of Journalism
 and Communication]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Speech and Communication in 1957. After a
 brief sojourn as a struggling actor in [[Los Angeles]], he was awarded the highly selective [[Woodr
ow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation|Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship]] in 1958. Maverick lite
rary critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] successfully importuned the regional fellowship committee to select t
he \"rough-hewn\" Kesey alongside more traditional grantees from [[Reed College]] and other elite in
stitutions.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D4nHLcSbno8C&pg=PA186&dq=ken+kesey+

acked the prerequisites to work toward a master's degree in English, Kesey elected to enroll in the 
non-degree creative writing program at [[Stanford University]] that fall, where he would develop lif
elong friendships with [[Ken Babbs]], [[Larry McMurtry]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Ed McClanahan]], [[Gu
rney Norman]], and [[Robert Stone (novelist)|Robert Stone]].<ref name=\"oregonianobit\"/>	91
92
While at Stanford, Kesey resided on Perry Lane (a historically [[bohemianism|bohemian]] enclave adja
cent to the university golf course) and clashed with program director [[Wallace Stegner]]; according
 to Stone, Stegner \"saw Kesey... as a threat to civilization and intellectualism and sobriety\" and
 rejected Kesey's [[Stegner Fellowship]] applications for the 1959–60 and 1960–61 terms.<ref>{{cite

gan the manuscript that would become ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the C

===Experimentation with psychoactive drugs===	97

At the instigation of Perry Lane neighbor and Stanford psychology graduate student Vik Lovell, an ac
quaintance of [[Richard Alpert]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], Kesey volunteered to take part in  what tur
ned out to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-financed study under the aegis of [[Project MKUL

d in the years of private experimentation that followed. 	99

Kesey's role as a medical guinea pig, as well as his stint working at the state veterans' hospital, 
inspired him to write ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. The success of this book, as well as the 
demolition of the Perry Lane cabins in August 1963, allowed him to move to a log house at 7940 La Ho
nda Road in [[La Honda, California]], about forty-five minutes into the dark, forested hills that li
e west of Perry Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Perry+Ave

ref> He frequently entertained friends and many others with parties he called \"[[Acid Tests]]\", in
volving music (such as Kesey's favorite band, The Warlocks, later known as the [[Grateful Dead]]), [
[black light]]s, fluorescent paint, [[strobe light|strobes]], and other \"[[psychedelia|psychedelic]
]\" effects, and, of course, LSD. These parties were noted in some of Ginsberg's poems and are also 
described in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', as well as ''[[Hell's Angels: 
The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'' by [[Hunter S. Thompson]] and ''Fre
ewheelin Frank, Secretary of the Hell's Angels'' by Frank Reynolds.	101
102
===''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''===	103
104
In 1959, Kesey wrote ''Zoo'', a novel about the [[beatnik]]s living in the [[North Beach, San Franci
sco, California|North Beach]] community of [[San Francisco]], but it was never published. In 1960, h
e wrote ''End of Autumn'', about a young man who leaves his [[working class|working-class]] family a
fter he gets a scholarship to an [[Ivy League]] school, also unpublished.	105
106
The inspiration for ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' 
came while working on the night shift (with [[Gordon Lish]]) at the [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo P
ark]] Veterans' Hospital. There, Kesey often spent time talking to the patients, sometimes under the
 influence of the hallucinogenic drugs with which he had volunteered to experiment. Kesey did not be
lieve that these patients were [[insane]], but rather that society had pushed them out because they 
did not fit the conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under th
e guidance of Cowley in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a suc
cessful [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|stage play]] by [[Dale Wasserman]], and in 1975, [[
Miloš Forman]] directed a [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|screen adaptation]], which won th
e \"Big Five\" Academy Awards: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for 
Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Jack Nicholson]]), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Lou
ise Fletcher]]), [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Forman) and [[Academy Award for 
Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Lawrence Hauben, [[Bo Goldman]]).	107
108
Kesey originally was involved in creating the film, but left two weeks into production. He claimed n
ever to have seen the movie because of a dispute over the $20,000 he was initially paid for the film
 rights. Kesey loathed the fact that, unlike the book, the film was not narrated by the Chief Bromde
n character, and he disagreed with Jack Nicholson's being cast as Randle McMurphy (he wanted [[Gene 
Hackman]]). Despite this, Faye Kesey has stated that Ken was generally supportive of the film and pl
eased that it was made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/31001/11-authors-who-hated

===Merry Pranksters===	111
112
When the publication of his second novel, ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Not
ion]]'' in 1964, required his presence in New York, Kesey, [[Neal Cassady]], and others in a group o
f friends they called the \"Merry Pranksters\" took a cross-country trip in a school bus nicknamed \
"[[Further (bus)|Further]]\".<ref name=\"si\">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collectio
ns/search/object/nmah_1275835 |title=National Museum of American History Collections: Signboard, Pas
s the Acid Test |publisher=americanhistory.si.edu|accessdate=2015-04-08}}</ref> This trip, described
 in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'' (and later in Kesey's own screenplay \"T
he Further Inquiry\") was the group's attempt to create art out of everyday life, and to experience 
roadway America while high on LSD. In an interview after arriving in New York, Kesey is quoted as sa
ying, \"The sense of communication in this country has damn near atrophied. But we found as we went 
along it got easier to make contact with people. If people could just understand it is possible to b
e different without being a threat.\"<ref name=\"NYTobit\"/> A huge amount of footage was filmed on 
16mm cameras during the trip which remained largely unseen until the release of the documentary film
 \"[[Magic Trip]]\" in 2011. 	113
114
After the bus trip, the Pranksters threw parties they called Acid Tests around the San Francisco Bay
 Area from 1965 to 1966. Many of the Pranksters lived at Kesey's residence in La Honda. In New York,
 Cassady introduced Kesey to [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]], who then turned them on to [[T
imothy Leary]]. ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (film)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' inspired a 1970 fil
m starring and directed by [[Paul Newman]]; it was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]], and in 1972
 was the first film shown by the new television network [[Home Box Office|HBO]], in [[Wilkes-Barre, 
Pennsylvania]].	115
116
Kesey was arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in 1965. In an attempt to mislead
 police, he faked suicide by having friends leave his truck on a cliffside road near [[Eureka, Calif
ornia|Eureka]], along with an elaborate suicide note, written by the Pranksters. Kesey fled to Mexic
o in the back of a friend's car. When he returned to the United States eight months later, Kesey was
 arrested and sent to the San Mateo County jail in [[Redwood City]], California, for five months whe
re he was introduced to a highly recommended San Francisco lawyer, Richard Potack, who specialized i
n marijuana cultivation. On his release, he moved back to the family farm in [[Pleasant Hill, Oregon
]], in the [[Willamette Valley]], where he spent the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://w

Kesey was diagnosed with [[diabetes]] in 1992. In 1994, he toured with members of the Merry Prankste
rs performing a musical play he wrote about the millennium called ''Twister: A Ritual Reality''. Man
y old and new friends and family showed up to support the Pranksters on this tour that took them fro
m Seattle's [[Bumbershoot]], all along the West Coast including a sold out two-night run at [[The Fi
